# <h>  **A Deep Learning Approach to Potato Leaf Disease Detection and Classification.**

**Potato Leaf Disease Classifier: Leveraged deep learning to create an image classifier for potato leaf diseases. Dataset sourced from Kaggle. Built a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify disease types from leaf images. Employed data preprocessing, augmentation, and layered architecture for accurate classification. Visualized training progress and model performance. Contributing to sustainable agriculture practices with AI-powered disease detection.**

1 - Acquiring a diverse and comprehensive dataset that covers various disease types, severity levels, lighting conditions, and stages of disease progression can be challenging

2 - Preprocessing agricultural images can be complex due to variations in background, lighting, and image quality.

3 - Deep learning models can be highly complex, making it challenging to interpret how they arrive at their predictions.

4 - Validating the model's accuracy and performance in real agricultural fields can be challenging due to variations in environmental conditions.

5 - Implementing the model in a real-world scenario, such as a mobile application used by farmers, requires optimization for real-time performance and minimal computational resources.

   <B> The aim of the Project is to: </B>
   
   1. . Develop a more generalized plant disease classification system that can identify various diseases across different types of crops
   
   2. Build a user-friendly mobile application that utilizes the trained model.
   
   3.  Implement a real-time monitoring system that continuously captures images and uses the model to detect diseases
   
   4.  Develop a system that not only detects diseases but also predicts how the diseases might spread and evolve over time.
   
   5. Create a collaborative platform where farmers can upload images of diseased leaves from their fields.
