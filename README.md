# <h>  **A Deep Learning Approach to Potato Leaf Disease Detection and Classification.**

**This is an innovative project that harnesses deep learning to transform potato agriculture. By utilizing a vast dataset of annotated potato leaf images, the project develops a powerful deep neural network to swiftly and accurately detect a range of leaf diseases. This technology offers a faster, more precise alternative to traditional diagnosis methods, aiding farmers in promptly managing and safeguarding their crops. The anticipated outcome is improved crop health, yield, and sustainability through the early identification of disease issues.

    1. Started with scrapping of the data from InstaHyre's website with Python and saving it into CSV files, imported the CSV files into an Excel file.
    
    2. Did the Data cleaning part with the help of Pandas and Power Query (MS Excel), imported the CSVs into MySQL for further analysis. 
 
    3. Imported CSVs in MySQL, created tables using Group By, Join, Trim, Constraints etc.
    
    4. Exported all the tables from MySQL to MS Excel and created required tables to gain some insights.
    
    5. Performed in depth analysis of the data in MS Excel using Pivot tables and charts.
    
    6. Created different charts from the table for better understanding of the data.
    
    7. Also Designed a Interactive Dashboard from the charts for better visualisation.
    
    8. Created some useful drop-downs for fetching the required Data like Standard Experience, Standard Role (Profiles) and Location.
    
    9. Created a Powerpoint presentation with all the insights and the conclusions listed with the in depth analysis.

   1. The companies with Employee size of above 1000 employees and above 50 (under 200) employees have the highest number of Job openings, whereas companies having less than 10 employees have least number of job openings. 
   
   2. There are highest number of job openings in Job Profiles like Management, Marketing and Software Engineers, whereas Job Profiles like Accountancy, Designers and Writers have the least number of job openings.
   
   3. Freshers (0-2 years of Experience) and Experts (above 15 years of Experience) are the least in demand segment of the job seekers, whereas Advanced (5-10 years of Experience) and Intermediate (between 2-5 years of Experience) are the highest in demand segment of the job seekers.
   
   4. Programming languages like Python, Java and Java script are the most in demand skills.
   
   5. Bangalore and Mumbai are the Cities with highest number of job openings.
   
   6. Work From Home is surprisingly the 3rd highest segment in locations with highest number of jobs, indicating the increasing preference of the companies for WFH in post pandemic period as it reduces the requirement of infrastructure for the company, reduces the cost of operations and also remains employee friendly.
